# Wine Dataset Classification
This repository contains Python code for classifying wine samples using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Naive Bayes classifiers. The code performs data preprocessing, feature selection using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and evaluates the performance of each classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains features of wine samples and the corresponding class labels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rohit-27-Patil/Wine-Dataset-Classification-using-KNN-SVM-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifiers.git

cd Wine-Dataset-Classification-using-KNN-SVM-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifiers


2. Run the Python script:

python Class Assessment 6.ipynb


## Contents

- `wine_classification.py`: Python script containing the code for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Approach

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset.
2. Feature selection is done using PCA to reduce dimensionality.
3. KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers are built and evaluated.
4. Model performance is compared and analyzed.

## Results

- KNN Classifier Accuracy:
- SVM Classifier Accuracy:
- Naive Bayes Classifier Accuracy:
