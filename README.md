# Wine Dataset Classification
This repository contains Python code for classifying wine samples using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Naive Bayes classifiers. The code performs data preprocessing, feature selection using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and evaluates the performance of each classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains features of wine samples and the corresponding class labels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
